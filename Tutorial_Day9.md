## The pipeline's main steps are:
* The MVP pipeline takes (meta)-genomic assemblies, reads, and metadata as inputs, and performs the following steps:

üî¥ **We will not run the commands as they take a long time and databases are very large**

## Questions

* **How many proviruses in the BGR_140717/ sample
* **How many viruses are in the BGR_140717 sample

- Hint look into folder 01_GENOMAD and find the *.fna virus files. Use grep ‚Äú?‚Äù

## Questions

* **How many Caudoviricetes viruses in the BGR_***/ sample? Any other viral taxonomies?

- Briefly look up and describe these viruses (ds/ss DNA/RNA and hosts (euk/prok)

* **How many High-quality and complete viruses in the BGR_***/ sample

- Hint look into folder 02_CHECKV and find the MVP_02_BGR_***_Filtered_Relaxed_Merged_Genomad_CheckV_Virus_Proviruses_Quality_Summary.ts files. Use grep ‚Äú?‚Äù -?

What is the length of the complete virus? How many viral hallmark genes?

Check how abundant is your complete virus in the different samples (RPKM)? Look into folders
04_READ_MAPPING/Subfolders/BGR_*_CoverM.tsv and find your viruses.
Create a table and summarize the RPKM value of the virus in the different samples.

Or look into folder 05_VOTU_TABLES


Now let‚Äôs look at annotated genes in 06_FUNCTIONAL_ANNOTATION and find the table: 
MVP_06_All_Sample_Filtered_Conservative_Merged_Genomad_CheckV_Representative_Virus_Proviruses_Gene_Annotation_GENOMAD_PHROGS_PFAM_Filtered.tsv



Now find/filter your complete virus and find the viral hallmark genes with a PHROG annotation (hint: look at the columns).
What are typical annotations you see? What could the functions be?  


Now look for the category of ‚Äúmoron, auxiliary metabolic gene and host takeover‚Äù any toxin genes???? Quickly look up the function of this toxin (hint, vibrio phage and vibrio cholerae host)

Now let‚Äôs look at the binning results
Look at 07_BINNING/07C_vBINS_READ_MAPPING/  and find table MVP_07_Merged_vRhyme_Outputs_Unfiltered_best_vBins_Memberships_geNomad_CheckV_Summary_read_mapping_information_RPKM_Table.tsv


How many High-quality viruses after binning in comparison to before binning? (hint: look carefully at the table, it has duplicate entries for bins)

Are any of the identified viral contigs complete circular genomes (based on identifying direct terminal repeat regions on both ends of the genome)?


You can also look at the table  07D_vBINS_vOTUS_TABLES and find table: MVP_07_Merged_vRhyme_Outputs_Filtered_conservative_best_vBins_Representative_Unbinned_vOTUs_geNomad_CheckV_Summary_read_mapping_information_RPKM_Table.tsv


Now finally let‚Äôs have a look at the potential predicted host of these complete viruses.
Look into folder 08_iPHoP
